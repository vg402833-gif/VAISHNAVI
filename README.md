MY FIRST PROJECT
# Assignment3
# Task1
# Recursive Factorial Program

## Description
This program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
Example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
## How It Works
- User enters a number.
- Function calls itself (recursion).
- Base case: if number is 1, return 1.
- Otherwise multiply number with (num - 1).

# Math Module Calculation Program
## Description
This program uses Python's math module to perform calculations on a number entered by the user.
## What It Does
- Takes a number as input from the user.
- Calculates:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays all calculated results.
## How It Works
- The program imports the math module.
- User enters a number.
- Built-in math functions like:
  - math.sqrt(num)
  - math.log(num)
  - math.sin(num)
  are used to calculate results.
- The results are printed on the screen.

## ASSIGNMENT 4
## Task 1
## Description
In this program:
A text file named textfile_of_task1 is created using write mode (xt).
The file is then opened in read mode (wt).
The file is then opened in read mode (rt).
The first two lines are read using readline() function.
The content is displayed on the screen.
A try-except block is used to handle errors if the file is not found.
## Concepts Used
open() function
Write mode (wt)
Read mode (rt)
write() method
readline() method
Exception handling (try-except)
## ASSIGNMENT 4
## Task 2
Write a Python program that:
Takes user input.
Writes the input to a file named output.txt.
Appends additional data to the same file.
Reads and displays the final content of the file.
## Working
The objective of this task is to understand and implement file handling in Python, including:
Writing data to a file
Appending data to an existing file
Reading data from a file
## Methods
write()
append() (using "at" mode)
read()
▶️ Program Workflow
The program asks the user to enter text.
The entered text is written into output.txt.
Additional text is appended to the same file.
The program reads the file content.
The final content is displayed on the screen.
