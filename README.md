# Recursive Factorial Program

## Description
This program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
Example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
## How It Works
- User enters a number.
- Function calls itself (recursion).
- Base case: if number is 1, return 1.
- Otherwise multiply number with (num - 1).

# Math Module Calculation Program
## Description
This program uses Python's math module to perform calculations on a number entered by the user.
## What It Does
- Takes a number as input from the user.
- Calculates:
  - Square root of the number
  - Natural logarithm (log base e)
  - Sine of the number (in radians)
- Displays all calculated results.
## How It Works
- The program imports the math module.
- User enters a number.
- Built-in math functions like:
  - math.sqrt(num)
  - math.log(num)
  - math.sin(num)
  are used to calculate results.
- The results are printed on the screen.
